This is just a bunch of gedit plugins extracted from gmate and
modified slightly to better suit my personal tastes.

  * Gemini: this is an old release since the latest fixes in
    gmate made it run havoc and totally unusable.
  * FuzzyOpen: I fixed the weird big and ugly fonts for something
    that's smoother to the eye.
  * Completion: uses the `Tab` key instead of `Return`, which I
    think is far less intrusive, and more importantly: doesn't
    anoy me every 2 secs.
  * Filesync: something I wrote and don't use anymore since.
